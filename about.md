**LnN**,
Yeah, ppl don't call me like that, but yeah, that's my full name.
I'm a guy nothing special, I haven't had any degrees or certificates, and how about my base? I had no base, just loved playing games, and was curious about computers and their software. I did a lot of things but I thought that I didn't need to put it here.
Okay, main story now. I just want to share my knowledge about pieces of stuff that I did. I'm a Security Engineer now, as a blue member... This blog will be full of ... that I think may help me or someone that I don't know...

*Thank You for reading!*
